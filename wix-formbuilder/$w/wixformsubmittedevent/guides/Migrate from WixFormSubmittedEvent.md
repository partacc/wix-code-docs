# Migrate from `WixFormSubmittedEvent` to `WixFormsV2`
As of April 2025, [`WixFormSubmittedEvent`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/velo/velo-only-apis/$w/wix-form-submitted-event/wix-form-field) is deprecated and any new forms created will only work with [`WixFormsV2`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/velo/velo-only-apis/$w/wix-forms-v2/introduction). You can access the functionality of [`WixFormSubmittedEvent`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/velo/velo-only-apis/$w/wix-form-submitted-event/wix-form-field) using [`onSubmitSuccess()`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/velo/velo-only-apis/$w/wix-forms-v2/on-submit-success) in [`WixFormsV2`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/velo/velo-only-apis/$w/wix-forms-v2/introduction).

Old forms will only work with the old APIs: [`WixForms`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/velo/velo-only-apis/$w/wix-forms/introduction), [`WixFormSubmitEvent`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/velo/velo-only-apis/$w/wix-form-submit-event/wix-form-fields), [`WixFormSubmittedErrorEvent`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/velo/velo-only-apis/$w/wix-form-submitted-error-event/code), and [`WixFormSubmittedEvent`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/velo/velo-only-apis/$w/wix-form-submitted-event/wix-form-field). You can see which forms are old forms and which are new forms by looking at the forms and submissions page in a site dashboard, where there's a tab for each.
